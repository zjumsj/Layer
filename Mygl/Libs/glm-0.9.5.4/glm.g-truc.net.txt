OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) is a header only C++ mathematics library for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specification and released under the MIT license.

This library provides classes and functions designed and implemented following as strictly as possible the GLSL conventions and functionalities so that when a programmer knows GLSL, he knows GLM as well, making it really easy to use.

This project isn't limited to GLSL features. An extension system provides extended capabilities: matrix transformations, quaternions, half-based types, random number generation, procedural noise functions, etc.

GLM ensures interoperability with third party libraries, SDKs and OpenGL; replacing advantageously the deprecated matrix functions. It is a good candidate for software rendering (Raytracing / Rasterisation), image processing, physic simulations and any context that requires a simple and convenient mathematics library.

It is a platform independent library with no dependence to external libraries even OpenGL. GLM is written in C++98 but can take advantage of C++11 when available. It supports the following compilers:
Clang 2.6 and higher
CUDA 3.0 and higher
GCC 3.4 and higher
Intel C++ Composer XE 2013 and higher
LLVM 2.3 through GCC 4.2 front-end and higher
Visual C++ 2005 and higher
Any conform C++98 or C++11 compiler
For more information about GLM, please have a look at the manual and the API reference documentation.
