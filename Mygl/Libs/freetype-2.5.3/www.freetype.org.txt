FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts.

It is written in C, designed to be small, efficient, highly customizable, and portable while capable of producing high-quality output (glyph images) of most vector and bitmap font formats.

Some products that use FreeType for rendering fonts on screen or on paper, either exclusively or partially:

GNU/Linux and other free Unix operating system derivates like FreeBSD or NetBSD
iOS, Apple's mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads
Android, Google's operating system for smartphones and tablet computers
ChromeOS, Google's operating system for laptop computers
Ghostscript, a PostScript interpreter used in many printers
Counting the above products only, you get more than a billion devices that contain FreeType.
